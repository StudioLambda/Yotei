# Yotei

Yotei is a powerful and flexible task scheduling library for Go, designed to handle a variety of concurrent tasks with ease. Utilizing a Weighted Round Robin (WRR) algorithm, this scheduler allows for efficient distribution of tasks among multiple workers, with support for custom task weights (priorities), sequential/concurrent tasks, and durations. Perfect for high-performance applications requiring fine-grained control over task execution.

## Features

- Weighted Round Robin (WRR) Scheduling: Efficiently distributes tasks among workers based on custom weights and priorities.
- Multiple Workers: Scale your task processing with support for multiple concurrent workers.
- Custom Task Weights: Assign specific weights to tasks to control their execution frequency and priority.
- Post-Task Actions: Define custom actions to be executed after each task is handled.
- Optional Task Locking: Ensure only a single worker processes a task at a time with optional task locking. Determines if the task is sequential or concurrent.
- Custom Task Duration: Specify exact durations for tasks, making them sleep if completed early or canceling their context if they run too long.
